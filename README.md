# Base_World
A world with common assets to get your campaign started.

On this repository's main page, click the green dropdown for "Code" and download zip                           
Make an empty folder called "c-team-heros" in the following directory: C:\Users\\<b><i>{Your Username}</i></b>\AppData\Local\FoundryVTT\Data\worlds\c-team-heros

Most of the assets are inside of compendiums which are located under "packs". If you are missing something specific, you could just add the .db (as opposed to replacing the world). Other things like settings, users, or folders live in the "data" folder. 

Note you may need to add an empty "scenes" folder inside of "c-team-heros", though Foundry should just make one for you.
