Common assets to get your world started

1) Navigate to a directory similar to this on your PC (with your PC username):     
    C:\Users\\<b><i>{Your Username}</i></b>\AppData\Local\FoundryVTT\Data\worlds
2) Create an empty folder called "c-team-heros"            
    ie: C:\Users\\<b><i>{Your Username}</i></b>\AppData\Local\FoundryVTT\Data\worlds\\<b><i>c-team-heros</i></b>
3) At the homepage for this repository, hit the green "<>Code" button and Download Zip 
4) Unzip the contents into ..\c-team-heros          
    Now there should be a data folder, packs folder, and world.json under the "c-team-heros" world
    *Note you may need add an empty folder named "scenes", however Foundry should be fine without it

Most content is stored inside compendiums for performance & bandwidth purposes. Keep them there to avoid pain. 
Compendiums are stored inside the "packs" folder. if you only need one specific thing, you could just add individual .db's directly to whatever world you want.
